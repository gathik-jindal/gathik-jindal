# Welcome to Gathik Jindal's GitHub Profile!

Hello! I'm Gathik Jindal, a first-year student at IIIT Bangalore, passionate about computer architecture and software development. This GitHub account showcases my projects and contributions in these areas.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **Nebula-S-Edge**: This a modern take on the classic 2D Space Invader genre. Players engage in wave-based space shooter mechanics, enjoy boss fights, and participate in multiplayer modes with secure account handling and real-time networking. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/AbhirathA/Nebula-s-Edge))

- **Moore Machine**: A simple Moore Machine implemented in Python, demonstrating the fundamentals of finite state machines. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/gathik-jindal/MooreMachine))

- **MIPS Processor Design**: A simulation of a non-pipelined MIPS processor accompanied by an assembler and GUI to inspect its step by step process. This project also includes three programs designed to run on the simulated processor. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/gathik-jindal/MIPS-Processor-Design))

- **PotterBot**: A Python-based discord bot that won the Hacknite at IIITB. It lets user play Harry Potter based games, progress through levels and store their data. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/SnehalSharma05/Hacknite))

- **IAS-ISA**: An assembler and simulator for the IAS (Institute for Advanced Study) Instruction Set Architecture, implemented in Python. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/gathik-jindal/IAS-ISA))

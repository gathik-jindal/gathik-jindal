# Welcome to Gathik Jindal's GitHub Profile!

Hello! I'm Gathik Jindal, a first-year student at IIIT Bangalore, passionate about computer architecture and software development. This GitHub account showcases my projects and contributions in these areas.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

- **KrishiMitra**: This program helps farmers directly connect and do business with the customer. We use AI and ML models to track prices of crops and give personalized insights the farmer related to its crops and fields. Our special feature is that all our features can be accessed through a call feature, where illiterate farmers can use the app via just a call that is automated by AI and NLP.

- **Nebula-S-Edge**: This a modern take on the classic 2D Space Invader genre. Players engage in wave-based space shooter mechanics, enjoy boss fights, and participate in multiplayer modes with secure account handling and real-time networking. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/AbhirathA/Nebula-s-Edge))

- **Moore Machine**: A simple Moore Machine implemented in Python, demonstrating the fundamentals of finite state machines. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/gathik-jindal/MooreMachine))

- **MIPS Processor Design**: A simulation of a non-pipelined MIPS processor accompanied by an assembler and GUI to inspect its step by step process. This project also includes three programs designed to run on the simulated processor. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/gathik-jindal/MIPS-Processor-Design))

- **PotterBot**: A Python-based discord bot that won the Hacknite at IIITB. It lets users play Harry Potter based games, progress through levels and store their data. ([Link to proj](https://github.com/SnehalSharma05/Hacknite))
